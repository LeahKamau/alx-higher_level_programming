# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

The ALx coursework project is completed using Python, and it includes a C-linked list challenge. The goal of this project is to learn lists, sequences and tuples Data Structures.

## Learning Objectives
Why Python programming is awesome

What are lists and how to use them

What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists

What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them

How to use lists as stacks and queues

What are list comprehensions and how to use them

What are tuples and how to use them

When to use tuples versus lists

What is a sequence

What is tuple packing

What is sequence unpacking

What is the del statement and how to use it
## Technologies
Python scripts are written in Python 3.8.5

All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
